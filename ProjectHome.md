This add-on adds a menu item to the tools menu to let you import play counts, metatdata, and loved tracks from last.fm.

The play counts are displayed in a sortable and selectable list. If the artist and track names do not match exactly you will have the opportunity to fix the match with the help of an auto-fixer. The Last.fm API does not supply information about the last played time so unfortunately I can't import that.

There are options to only import counts if the last.fm play count is higher than the current play count, and an option to import the count to all duplicate songs or just a single one. It also includes an option to reset all play counts to 0, and to add to the existing play count instead of resetting it.

There are also other options to save the corrections from the not in library tab to your library or to file. I do not recommend the use of auto-fix all when saving to metadata as it can easily get confused and pick the wrong song. A better option is to fix things individually and check each fix. Also back up your library before saving to file, just in case anything goes wrong.

You can also import your loved tracks into a playlist. The last.fm API limits the number of loved tracks you can access to 50, so unfortunately if you have more than 50 it will only import the latest 50. The playlist will be updated every time you import the loved tracks, so you can use the command more than once and your loved tracks playlist will stay up-to-date.

It does not require a last.fm account, just a username, so you can import your friend's play counts or loved tracks for fun and profit.
